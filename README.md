# MRI Preprocessing: ML implementation in segmentation
I worked on this code during my internship at CNALab, starting in January 2022. My principal investigator (Jong-Min Lee) and a graduate student (Seonggyu Kim) oversaw the project, and we had meetings every other week to track progress. The goal was to build a preprocessing pipeline for machine learning. The duration of this project spanned approximately 8 months and contributed towards fulfilling my graduation requirements.
